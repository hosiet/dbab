Description: dnsmasq-based ad-blocking using pixelserv
 Block accessing to the ad sites from the DNS level. dbab is feather weight,
 both in terms of package size and CPU usage, because no pattern matching or
 string substitution involved. Thus it is super efficient and extremely
 fast.  All ads will be replaced by a 1Ã—1 pixel gif image served locally by
 the tiny pixelserv server. The ad-block list can be peirodically downloaded
 from pgl.yoyo.org, with the ability of local tweaking.
