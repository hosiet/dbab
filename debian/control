Description: dnsmasq-based ad-blocking using pixelserv
 Block accessing to the ad sites from the DNS level, super fast and
 efficient because no pattern matching or string substitution involved.
 All ads will be replaced by a 1Ã—1 pixel gif image served locally by
 the tiny pixelserv server. The block list can be peirodically
 downloaded from pgl.yoyo.org, with the ability of local tweaking.
